## Description
In this session, we will introduce how the different “SAP Suite Qualities” - such as ‘Seamless user experience,’ ‘Consistent security and identity management,’ and ‘One workflow inbox’- play a critical role in SAP’s Integration Strategy, providing added value on top of SAP Business Technology Platform.
