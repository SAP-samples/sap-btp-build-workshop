# Suite Qualities

Integrated enterprises offer a consistent experience throughout end-to-end key processes.
In 2020, SAP introduced distinct suite qualities that characterize integrated SAP applications.

## Seamless user experience

Improve the daily work experience of end users with a common look and feel for SAP solutions across end-to end
business processes. The SAP Start site serves as a central entry point for cloud solutions from SAP and utilizes SAP
Build Work Zone, delivering integrated search functionality and the SAP Task Center service integration for workflow
approvals, tasks, and recommended business insights content. The scope includes content from SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors solutions, and SAP Fieldglass solutions.. 
Additional cloud solutions are on SAP’s roadmap. 
You can either use SAP Start “as is” and directly benefit from its features, choose to implement your own customized entry point scenario using SAP Build Work Zone.
